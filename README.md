1. Bubble Sort:
Compares every pair of adjacent elements and swaps them so that the largest element is at the end of the list by the first iteration, then repeats until the whole list is sorted.
Best Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) 


2. Insertion Sort:
Loops the array to find the min value and the max value and moves them to the start / end of the array then loops on the unsorted array until the whole list is sorted.
Best Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) 


3. Selection Sort:
Searches for the smallest element in the array and moves it to first unsorted index, then repeats until the whole list is sorted.
Best Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2) 


4. Quick Sort:
Pick a 'pivot' element from the array and rearrange the array so smaller numbers go before the pivot, and bigger go after, and the pivot is in its right place. Repeat this recursively on the left and right sides of the initial pivot until array is fully sorted.
Best Case: O(nlog(n))
Worst Case: O(n^2)
